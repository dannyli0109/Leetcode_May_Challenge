### [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/534/week-1-may-1st-may-7th/3319/)

---

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 ```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 ```

**Note:**

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
3. This question is the same as 1009: [https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)

- right shift by one and add the current power to the sum
- modular do the same thing

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int digits = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while(num > 0) {
            // num % 2 == 1
            if (!(num & 1)) sum += pow(2, digits);
            num = num >> 1;
            digits++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
